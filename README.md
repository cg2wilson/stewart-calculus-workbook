# Workbook for Stewart's "Calculus", 8/e or 9/e

This repository contains the current files for the workbooks I use in my classes. Currently, the repository contains information for the following classes:

* Math 1823: Calculus & Analytic Geometry I
* Math 2423: Calculus & Analytic Geometry II
* Math 1914: Differential & Integral Calculus I

A long-term project will be to create content for the following classes as well: 

* Math 2433: Calculus & Analytic Geometry III
* Math 2443: Calculus & Analytic Geometry IV
* Math 2924: Differential & Integral Calculus II 
* Math 2934: Differential & Integral Calculus III

The "tex" subfolder contains the .tex files associated to the workbook, and the "pretext" subfolder contains the corresponding PreTeXt code to create the web interface.

There are likely errors in individual files as well as discrepancies between the .tex and .ptx versions of sections.
