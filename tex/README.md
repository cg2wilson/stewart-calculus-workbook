# TeX Files for Workbook

This folder contains the TeX files for the workbook; the PreTeXt files (with hopefully consistent code) is contained in the parent folder.

This is the folder from which I build the physical workbook; eventually there will be different "notes.tex" files to differentiate between the courses:

* Math 1823: Calculus & Analytic Geometry I
* Math 2423: Calculus & Analytic Geometry II
* Math 2433: Calculus & Analytic Geometry III
* Math 2443: Calculus & Analytic Geometry IV
* Math 1914: Differential & Integral Calculus I
* Math 2924: Differential & Integral Calculus II 
* Math 2934: Differential & Integral Calculus III
