						<title>Rolle's Theorem</title>
						<statement>
							Let <m>f</m> be a function that satisfies the following three properties:
							<ul>
								<li>
									<m>f</m> is continuous on the closed interval <m>[a,b]</m>.
								</li>
								<li>
									<m>f</m> is differentiable on the open interval <m>(a,b)</m>.
								</li>
								<li>
									<m>f(a) = f(b)</m>.
								</li>
							</ul>
							Then, there is some number <m>c</m> in <m>(a,b)</m> such that <m>f'(c) = 0</m>.

						Rolle's Theorem has three hypotheses<m>-</m>conditions upon which the conclusion depends.
						<ol label="a">
							<li>
								If we remove the first hypothesis, does Rolle's Theorem still hold?  Give an argument why or why not, and include a picture if possible.

							<li>
								If we remove the second hypothesis, does the theorem still hold?  Give an argument why or why not, and include a picture if possible.

								If the third hypothesis is removed, what then?  Justify as before.

					Verify that <m>f(x) = x^3-2x^2-4x+2</m> satisfies the hypotheses of Rolle's Theorem on <m>[-2,2]</m>, then find all numbers <m>c</m> that satisfy the conclusion of Rolle's Theorem.

				<example><statement>
					Draw the graph of a function that is continuous on <m>[0,8]</m>, with <m>f(0) = 1</m> and <m>f(8) = 4</m>, but that does <em>not</em> satisfy the conclusion of the Mean Value Theorem on <m>[0,8]</m>.

				<example><statement>
					In the Mean Value Theorem, we assume that <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m>.  Since differentiablity implies continuity, why do we have to assume continuity on <m>[a,b]</m>?
