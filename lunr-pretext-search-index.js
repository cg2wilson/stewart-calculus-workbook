  "body": " Four Ways to Represent a Function    Represent relations verbally, numerically, graphically or algebraically and translate between representations.  Determine if a relation is a function, and represent functions using appropriate notation.  Evaluate and graph piecewise functions (including absolute value and step functions).  Determine if a function is even, odd, or neither using multiple representations.  Graphically determine the intervals over which a function is increasing, decreasing, or constant.  Evaluate functions using numerical or algebraic input, particularly difference quotients.     Before Class   Pre-Class Video 1     Pre-Class Video 2     Functions  A relation is a rule which links an input variable to an output ; given one piece of information, we can determine the corresponding piece. A special type of relation is one called a function.   Function\/Domain\/Range  Function  Domain  Range A function  is a rule that assigns to each element in a set  one element, called , in a set . The set is called the domain of the function. The range of is the set of all possible values of as varies throughout the domain.   Independent Variable\/Dependent Variable  Independent Variable  Dependent Variable A symbol that represents an arbitrary element in the domain is called an independent variable . A symbol representing an arbitarary element in the range of a function is called a dependent variable .  Let represent the number of courses offered campus-wide during the week at time , and represent the number of students walking on the South Oval at time last Monday. Is a function? What about ?   is not a function because at least one input has multiple outputs (for example, Monday at 12:00pm has multiple classes). is a function because at time last Monday specifically, there is a only one number of students on the South Oval.   Fill out the table with the domain and range of the given function. Write your answer in interval notation.

The price of gas at a certain 7-11 in Norman was $4.37 per gallon on June 26th.  Is this information presented numerically, algebraically, verbally, or graphically?  Represent this situation in the other three ways.

The length of its base is twice its width. Material for the base costs $5 per square meter; material for the sides costs $3 per square meter. Express the cost of materials as a function of the width of the base.   dollars    Vertical Line Test  A curve in the plane is the graph of a function of if and only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once.   Are both of these graphs functions? Why or why not?   The image on the left is the graph of the curve on the interval .     The image on the right is the graph of the curve whose coordinate is given by the rule , and whose coordinate is given by the rule .      The first graph is a function because it passes the vertical line test, but the second is not a function because it fails the vertical line test between .

Each input (except ) has multiple outputs     In Class   Piecewise Defined Functions  A piecewise function is a function defined by different formulas in different parts of their domains.  A quick example of a piecewise function is the absolute value function :   What is What about ?  What is ? Why?  Sketch on the interval .

There is a more rigorous definition given in Section 1.7. One important aspect of the definition of a limit is that we do not require the function to exist at the input .   A Word About Notation  In mathematics, notation is the way you succinctly communicate your ideas. Notation is part of the language of math; proper notation ensures proper communication. Please pay very careful attention to how I am writing the notation in class.  Notation can be a confusing aspect of mathematics; that's ok. It happens for Calculus I students and even for tenured professors. If you have any questions, please refer to your notes and\/or ask me! I am happy to help you navigate things that are confusing or don't make sense to you.   Draw three graphs so that the limit is defined at the input , but is distinct at all three points. This illustrates three possibilities when dealing with limits.     The graph of with a point located at      The graph of with the point located at removed     The graph of with a point located at removed and moved above       Consider . What is ?

Explain your answer.  Nothing changes; the limit cares about \"expected\" output, not actual output.     Translate the expression from math into English. Explain the sentence you wrote.  Is it possible for to be instead of 7? Why or why not?      As approaches 3, the output approaches 7. This means that when the inputs get close to 3, the outputs get closer to 7  Yes. Limits are concerned with expected output, not actual output; a function can have a different output than its limit at the same point.       In Class   One-Sided Limits  When we developed the intuition of a limit, we looked at input values which were smaller and larger than our desired input. These values are to the left and right of our input; secretly, we were taking one-sided limits .   One-Sided Limits Suppose is defined when is near the input . We write and say  the limit of , as approaches from the right, equals or approaches as approaches from the right   if we can make the values of arbitrarily close to by restricting to be sufficiently close to (using ). We write  and say  the limit of , as approaches from the left, equals or approaches as approaches from the left   if we can make the values of arbitrarily close to by restricting to be sufficiently close to (using )    Existence of a Limit  A function has a limit at if and only if its one-sided limits exist and agree.

Conditions for Continuity  Continuity of a function requires three things:   is in the domain of    exists        Look back at Section 1.5 and the conditions for the existence of a limit. What connections can you draw between the existence of a limit and the conditions for continuity?  In order for a function to be continuous, the limit must exist.   Use the graph to find the following:  The graph has some discontinuities; I'm not sure how to describe the graph without giving away the question.           Is continuous at ?        Is continuous at ?        Is continuous at ?            No        No        Yes      Types of Discontinuities  There are three kinds of discontinuities which we will encounter:  Vertical Asymptote  Jump Discontinuity  Removable Discontinuity     Sketch an example of each of the three kinds of discontinuities.     The graph of a function with a vertical asymptote-type discontinuity. As approaches the asymptote, the output on the right approaches and the output on the left approaches .     The graph shows jump discontinuities; the graph jumps from one output value to another.     Here a parabola has a removable discontinuity at its vertex; the output at the vertex has been \"moved\" to above the vertex rather than on it.        Continuity from the Right and Left  Continuity (Right and Left) A function is said to be continuous from the right at input if , and is continuous from the left at input if .     Pre-Class Activities  Use the graph below to answer the following questions:   State the numbers at which is discontinuous, and classify each as a vertical asymptote , jump discontinuity , or removable discontinuity .  For each of the numbers in (a), determine whether is right-continuous, left-continuous, or neither.  Use interval notation to write where is continuous.      At we have a removable discontinuity; at and , there are jump discontinuities; at there is a vertical asymptote.  At the function is left and right continuous; at , the function is left continuous; and , the function is right continuous; at the function is right continuous.        Sketch the graph of a function that is continuous everywhere, but is:  Discontinuous at   Left-continuous at   Has a removable discontinuity at     Answers vary     In Class  Show that is right-continuous, but not left-continuous at integer values.  Let be any integer. For right continuity, we need to show that . Note that , and that . Thus, the function is right continuous. Similarly, for left continuity, we require . However, and ; thus, the function is not left continuous.   Show that the function is continuous on the interval .   We prove the claim in three steps: (1) show continuity at the left endpoint; (2) show continuity at the right endpoint; (3) show continuity on the interval .  For continuity at , we need to show right continuity of the function at the point. For this to be true, . Then, Since , the function is right continuous.  For continuity at , we need to show left continuity of the function at the point. For this to be true, . Then, Since , the function is left continuous.  For continuity on , let be arbitrary. For continuity, we need to show that . Then, Since , the function is continuous on , and thus continuous on the interval .     Useful Results   Properties of Continuous Functions  If and are continuous at , and if is a constant, then the following functions are all continuous at :            , for         Prove the first property of continuous functions.  We want to show that . Since and are continuous, we know that and . Then, By the sum\/difference limit law from Section 1.6, we can rewrite the left hand side as Which is what we wanted to show.   Can you prove the remaining 4 properties?  The proofs run similarly to the previous Example 1.8.11, utilizing limit laws from Section 1.6.    Types of Continuous Functions  The following functions are continuous on their domain:  Polynomials  Rational Functions  Root Functions  Trigonometric Functions     Find the interval(s) on which the following functions are continuous                                   The Intermediate Value Theorem   Intermediate Value Theorem  Suppose that is continuous on the closed interval , and let be any number between and , where . Then, there exists a number in such that .   Here's a sketch illustrating why the Intermediate Value Theorem is true:    The image shows a function which dips below the axis and rises back to a max, drops to a min, rises to a max again, then falls. There is a line at some output which shows the intersection of the function with the line . The function intersects the line at four points; . There is a dashed line from each intersection to the axis, with labels.     Why does a function need to be continuous in order to guarantee the conclusion of the Intermediate Value Theorem? Sketch a graph to support your idea.   If the function is not continuous, is not guaranteed to exist or the limit may not exist.

This image shows a function with a jump discontinuity at , which means the output is not in the range of the function.        Show that the equation has a root between 1 and 2.

Continuity requires that ; for differentiability, we require that . Rearrangement of the differentiability condition should give something similar the condition for continuity.    Differentiability vs. Continuity  If a function is differentiable, then it is continuous; the reverse is not true.   There are several characteristics which indicate that a graph is not differentiable at a point:  A sharp corner  A discontinuity  A vertical tangent line      Other Notations       When we want to evaluate a derivative, we often use a vertical bar to communicate that we are evaluating.

Consider the function .  Use the methods of Section 3.3 to find the critical point of ; give your answer as an ordered pair.  Sketch the graph of to visually confirm your answer from (a).  Now suppose that gives the profit (in hundred dollars) that a company makes from a certain product, when thousand units are sold.

In the previous example, you were given the function for profit. More often than not, however, you will need to develop the formula for yourself. A farmer has 2400 ft of fencing and wants to fence off a rectangular field that borders a straight river. He needs no fence along the river. What are the dimensions of the field with the largest area?  Let be the length of the side parallel to the river, and be length of the perpendicular sides. Then, and     Strategy for Optimization    Draw a picture of the situation (if possible). Label all pieces of your diagram with a variable that will not confuse you later.  Use the picture (or the description) to find equation(s) which relate to the problem.  Identify the equation which will be optimized. Use the equations from (2) and algebra to reduce the variables in the optimizing equation, and simplify.  Take the derivative of your optimizing equation, set it equal to zero, and solve.  If necessary, use your answer to find the remaining pieces of information.     The key to optimization problems is practice . Many optimization problems follow a similar pattern, and require only slight modification from other problems. Practice is the only way that one will learn and recognize these patterns and tricks.  A cylindrical can is to hold 1 L of oil. Find the dimensions that will minimize the cost of the metal to manufacture the can.  Let be the radius of the can, be the height.

Compare your estimates to the previous two calculations.   and     What do you think would happen to our approximation of area if we used more rectangles?  We would get a better approximation.   Generically, the process we used above has the following steps:   Approximating Area Under a Curve    Determine the length of the interval  Divide the interval into equal subintervals  Find the area of each subinterval's rectangle  Sum the areas of the rectangles       If the interval we are concerned about is , and we are using rectangles to approximate the area, how could we write the base length of each individual rectangle?

Using the previous two exercises, write an expression for , the sum of areas of our approximating rectangles.                  From this, we can generalize to two special situations.

Right Rectangle Approximation  The right rectangle approximation for the area under the curve on the interval (using rectangles) is given by or, in sigma notation, The th right rectangle approximation is denoted .     Sigma Notation   Sigma notation is a shorthand way to write sums. For example, for the left-rectangle approximation , instead of writing we would write Here, refers to the starting index , and is called the ending index .     Pre-Class Activities   Consider .

Evaluate          Steps for substitution    Identify the chain rule term; call it   Differentiate so that you end up with something that looks like   Solve for , and substitute into the integral.  If we have a definite integral rather than an indefinite integral, we add a fourth step prior to integrating:  Change the bounds of integration by setting and and solving. These are your new bounds of integration.      Integrals of Symmetric Functions  For symmetric functions, we have the following properties:  If is continuous on and is even, then   If is continuous on and is odd, then         Pre-Class Activities   Since the chain rule is something that gives many students trouble, using the substitution rule sometimes also gives people trouble.
